# JavaScript Variables & Datatypes Exercise

In this week’s team session, you will practice JavaScript basics and work on applying the concepts we have learned throughout the week. This will be done during the scheduled team session, you decide in the team if you do it in small groups or pairs.

### Instructions:

Take a look into the index.js file and follow the instructions to complete the exercises 1-7 (n 8 is a bonus exercise). Collaborate with others using a pair/mob programming approach with LiveShare.

### Hint:

Don't use `var`, stick to `let` and `const`.

## Getting Started with the Project

Fork this repository and start working in your local environment (you can download LiveServer to run your project locally).
